# Scalathesis
A Scala wrapper for the nascent 
[hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) [RESTful/HTTP API](http://h.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html). 
Based on the Perl module: https://github.com/bbarker/Hypothesis-API

## Building

This is an example on how to cross compile code to Scala.js and Scala JVM.

To try it out, launch sbt and type:

    sbt> scalathesisJS/run
    sbt> scalathesisJVM/run

More information can be found in the
[Scala.js documentation](http://www.scala-js.org/doc/sbt/cross-building.html).
